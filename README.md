Our platform, Intelligym, is designed to make the gym-going experience more efficient and convenient for  trainees, while also providing a powerful management tool for gym staff, coaches and nutritionists. The platform is composed of two major parts:
The mobile application: This app is designed to simplify the process of getting into the gym and having an efficient session. The app's main feature is a session timer that starts and finishes a session using a QR code scanner, making it easy for trainees to check in and out of the gym. Additionally, the app features a special billing system using Intelicoins, a unique currency to the platform. These coins can be paid for online or at the gym reception desk and can be used for various services within the gym. The app also provides a history of all sessions, which allows users to track their progress and monitor their gym habits. Furthermore, the app includes a leaderboard feature which rewards the top users with discounts on Intellicoins, helping to motivate users to stay active.
The app also includes various reminders to help users stay on track, such as reminders to go to the gym, end a session if they forget, or even charge their Intelicoins balance if they don't have enough credits left. The app also includes a map feature that shows nearby gyms, allowing users to easily find new gyms to train in. Users can also view coaches, nutritionists and gyms' posts, contact them and hire those coaches. They can also view stats like step count and much more.
The website: This aspect of the platform is geared towards gym staff, coaches, and nutritionists, and focuses on management. The website allows users to register as a gym or coach, create posts and announcements, specify costs and information, and purchase ads. This makes it easy for gyms to promote their services, and for coaches and nutritionists to market their skills to potential clients. Additionally, the website provides a powerful set of tools to help gym staff manage their business, from tracking membership numbers to managing employee schedules.
Overall, the Intelligym platform is a comprehensive solution for both gym trainees and gym staff, providing a range of features to make the gym-going experience more efficient and convenient, while also providing a powerful management tool for gym staff, coaches, and nutritionists.
